# System Design

Similar to Langchain Agent that generates *Plan*s and then execute plans for final answers:
- `Reasoner` is the agent that divides given question into a tree of `Questionable`, `Actionable` and `Answerable`.
  - `Resonable` is the abstract class derived by `Questionable`, `Actionable` and `Answerable`.
  - `Questionable` generates N follow-up questions for the given question.
  - `Actionable` looks up public APIs or internal LLM's knowledge bank for giving the answer. _Note_: This is one of the leaf nodes in the knowledge search tree.
  - `Answerable` is generated by `Questionable` which holds the LLM generated answer. _Note_: This is one of the leaf nodes in the knowledge search tree.
- `AnswerRefiner` filters out the invalid answers and consolidate the answer candidates from `Reasoner` to a final answer.
